# The Turing Way Accessibility Working Group

Collaboration of community members interested in enhancing the accessibility of The Turing Way book *and* the collaborative community.

## People

* Anne Lee Steele and Liz Hare have been serving as co-leads.
* Sophia Batchelor has written a chapter on inclusive events 
* MetaDocencia collaboration

---

# [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org)

> MetaDocencia is an organization that works towards making the production, communication, and application of scientific and technical knowledge globally equitable. It aims to advance innovation with a local perspective that responsibly builds scientific and technical capacities through the co-creation of networks, learning spaces, and accessible resources for Spanish-speaking communities. --Patricia Loto

# What is accessibility?


> "Accessibility as a set of community-wide, behavioral, social, technical decisions 
 we take to ensure people with disabilities are welcome and are 
 able to participate in a community or event. --Andrea SÃ¡nchez-Tapia
 
## A Broader Definition

We can think about removing barriers for groups of people without disabilities like:

* Time Zomes
* Language
* Bandwidth
* Child and eldercare responsibilities


---

# Accessibility Examples

The term *accessibility* is used in many ways. 

.pull-left[

### 1. Accessibility practices related to disability

Examples:  
- ensuring materials are accessible with a screen reader
- providing live captions of technical meetings
- avoiding unnecessary cognitive complexity
- providing frequent breaks 
]

.pull-right[
### 2. Accessibility in a broader sense

Examples:  

- making materials that can be accessed by users with lower bandwidth
- making materials that will be functional on older computers or mobile devices
- considering worldwide time zones

# Projects

* Drafting an [accessibility policy](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3146/files/63d9fd424084fef6eb6f8f5bd297c097d0230eeb..f0913ef2ef4140d4fa8fff7030abcdc630c93a95)

* Planning and writing a new [Guide for Accessibility](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3427)

* Sophia Batchelor's chapter on [Inclusive Events for People with Lived Experience]](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3307) has a lot of overlap with accessibility.

* Work with event and Book Dash organizers to remove barriers, identify accessible collaboration tools, and enhance inclusion of diverse collaborators.
* Continue to learn about inclusion in general and specific practices to enhance accessibility
